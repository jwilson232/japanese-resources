## Lesson 1
#### There are three types of Japanese core sentence

| Structure                   | English Example    | Japanese Example  | Notes |
| -------------------------   | ---------------    | ----------------- | ----- |
| A does B (Verb う)           | Sakura Walks       | さくらが歩く        | Every Japanese sentence revolves around が but we cant always see it. が marks the grammatical subject of a sentence.　       |
| A is B (Noun だ)　           | Sakura is Japanese | さくらが日本人だ     | だ states that something is a certain way. |
| A is B (Adjective い)       | The pen is red     | ぺんが赤い          | All Japanese adjectives end with い. The い in 赤い means `is red` not just `red`. The `い` particle serves the same function as the だ particle.

### Example Sentences
#### A does B (Verb う) `さくらが歩く`
1. 鳥が分かる (The bird understands)
2. 少年が食べる (The boy eats)
3. 木が待つ (The tree waits)
4. 女の人が見る (The woman sees)
5. 子犬が泳ぐ (The puppy swims)

#### A is B (Noun だ) `さくらが日本人だ`
1. そのが男だ (That is a man)
2. 私が人だ (I am a person)
3. あれが牛だ (That over there is a cow)
4. マンチェスターが町だ (Manchester is a town)
5. テスコが店だ (Tesco is a shop)

#### A is B (Adjective い) `ぺんが赤い`
1. 中国が赤い (China is Red)
2. 頭が大きい (Head is big)
3. 空が青い (Sky is blue)
4. 猫が丸い (Cat is round)
5. 車が速い (Car is fast)

## Lesson 2

Although we always have the `A が B` structure as described in lessons 1, the A section is not always visible. Whilst it's not always visible it is always present, and can be represented as `Ø が B`

```I am Joe → [Øが] ジョーだ -> ジョーだ```

Depending on the context the `Øが` may change. For example if I saw a bird in the tree:

```It is a bird → [Øが] 鳥だ　→ 鳥だ```
#### を Particle
The を particle tells us something more about A or B.

```I eat cake →　私が ケエキを 食べる　→ [Øが] ケーキを 食べる　→ ケーキを 食べる```
### Example Sentences

| English               | Invisible が                | Øが   |
| -------------------------   | ---------------    | ----------------- |
| I speak English       | イギリス語を話す           　| [Øが]イギリスを話す |
| I wait         | 持つ                  | [Øが]持つ |
| I swim fast | 速いを泳ぐ　| [Øが]速いを泳ぐ |
| It is February | 二月だ| [Øが]二月だ

## Lesson 3
#### は Particle
The は particle can never be a part of the core sentence structure (the car of the the engine). は is a non-logical particle. は flags something as the topic of the sentence.

```As for me (I) am English → 私は [Øが] イギリス人だ```

In this context the `Øが` is the same as `私は`, however this isn't always the case. If we where ordering food at a restaurant and said:

```As for me (I'll have) the eel → 私わ [Øが] 鰻だ```

If the `Øが` was `私は` we would be saying `As for me (I am) the eel`, but in this case the `Øが` is `it` and in this context `it` is the meal.

#### に Particle
With the inclusion of the に we have a trio of logical particles:

| Particle | Description      |
| -------- | -----------      |
| が       | Doer (Subject)   |
| を       | Done to (Object) |
| に       | Target (Indirect Object) |

The を and に particle tell us more about the verb/train of the sentence, whilst the が is the subject of the sentence.

```I throw the ball → 私が ボールを 投げる```

```I throw the ball at Sakura → 私が ボールを さくらに 投げる```

The に tells us the target/destination, which is Sakura in this context. It is the logical particles が, を and に that tell us what is happening in this sentence, but the ordering of the words doesn't matter as it does in English, instead the logical particles change what is happening.

```Sakura throws the ball to me → 私に さくらが ボールを 投げる```

```The ball throws Sakura to me → ボールが 私に さくらを 投げる```

When we change a noun from one logical particle to another we change what is happening `ボールが → さくらが`. When we change a non-logical particle `は` the sentence stays in the same but we change the emphasis.

```As for me, (I) throw the ball to Sakura → 私は [Øが] さくらに ボールを 投げる```

```As for the ball, I throw (it) to Sakura → ボールをは 私が さくらに [Øを] 投げる```

```As for Sakura, I throw the ball (to her) → さくらは 私が ボールを [Øに] 投げる```

### Example Sentences
が, を and に
- 少年が 玉ねぎを 食べる (The boy eats onions)
- 少年が 玉ねぎを 台所に 食べる (The boy eats onions in the kitchen)
- 女の人が 馬を 見る (The woman sees a horse)
- 女の人が 馬を 町に 見る (The woman sees a horse in town)
- 鳥が 考古学を 分かる (The bird understands archeology)
- 木が 林に 待つ (The tree waits in the forest)

は
- 少年は [Øが] 玉ねぎを 台所に 食べる (As for the boy, (he) eats onions in the kitchen)
- 玉ねぎは 少年が [Øを] 台所に 食べる (As for the onion, (it) eats the boy in the kitchen)
- 女の人は [Øが] 馬を 町に 見る (The woman, (she) sees a horse in the town)
- 町は 女の人が 馬を [Øに] 見る(In the town, the woman sees a horse (in it))
- 林は 木が [Øに] 待つ (In the forest the tree waits)
- 鳥は [Øが] 考古学を 分かる (The bird understands archeology)
  
## Lesson 4

Until this point we have been using the non-past tense. This is the same the English non-past tense e.g. ```食べる - Eat```  and ```歩く - Walk```

If we took the below English sentence as an example: 

```I walked to the cafe, and now I eat cake and drink coffee```

It should instead say:

```I walked to the cafe, and now I am eating cake and drinking coffee```

`I eat cake` would instead instead be used to express that we sometimes eat cake / are cake eaters. We can also use the non-past plain form to describe future events: ```Next week I fly to Tokyo```. In a book we could also say ```The sun sinks over the sea and a small happy robot runs across the beach```, but this wouldn't make sense if spoken.

The Japanese non-past tense defaults to the future. 

```犬が食べる - The dog will eat```

``` さくらが歩く - Sakura will walk```

To instead say `the dog is eating` we need to add `いる`. This would be the same for every verb of being in English. For example:

- Sakura is walking
- You are walking 
- I am waling 

The `is`, `are` and `am` can all be represented by `いる`.

```The dog is eating - 犬が食べている```

In English we would say `The dog is eating` instead of `The dog is eat`. By changing `食べる` to `食べて` we are doing the same thing. We would use `て` for the continues present tense and `た` for the past tense. To get these forms follows the same pattern, and is discussed in lesson 5.

Relative time nouns do not require a particle when prefacing a sentence:

```Tomorrow I will eat cake - 明日ケエキを食べる```

Where as relative time nouns such as Tuesday, 6 o clock, February must use the に particle. 

```六時にケイキを食べる - at 6 o clock I will eat cake```

We can determine if a time is non-relative if in English we must describe it with on, at or in, and therefore me must use に.

## Lesson 5

#### Ichidan Verbs

The simplest verb conjugation. SImply remove the る and add the the required particle. Sometimes called る verbs, but would make more sense to call them いる/える verbs as they can end:

| いる verbs | える verbs |
| -------- | ----------- |
| りる       | ねる   |
| ひる       | へる |
| にる       | ねる |      
| ちる       | てる|
| しる       | せる |  
| みる       | める |　 
| きる       | ける |
| いる       |える |
  
#### Godan Verb

Five level verbs, can only end in one of the following:

| Ending Group | Pattern (て Form) | Mnemonic | 
| ------------ | ----------------- | -------- |
| う つ る      |   って　　| うつる　(Move from one thing to another) |

## Lesson 6

To recap from lesson 1 there are three core Japanese sentence types:

| Structure                   | English Example    | Japanese Example  | Notes |
| -------------------------   | ---------------    | ----------------- | ----- |
| A does B (Verb う)           | Sakura Walks       | さくらが歩く        | Every Japanese sentence revolves around が but we cant always see it. が marks the grammatical subject of a sentence.　       |
| A is B (Noun だ)　           | Sakura is Japanese | さくらが日本人だ     | だ states that something is a certain way. |
| A is B (Adjective い)       | The pen is red     | ぺんが赤い          | All Japanese adjectives end with い. The い in 赤い means `is red` not just `red`. The い particle serves the same function as the だ particle.

All three types can also be used as an adjective:

#### Adjectives

A simple adjective structure would be:

``` ペンが　赤い → The pen is red ```

We could rearrange the sentence to instead say:

``` 赤い　ペンが　小さい → The red pen is small``` 

Is we move `赤い` to the front to describe the pen we must add a new carriage to the front to drive the sentence, in this example `小さい`

#### Verbs

Any `う` engine (verb), in any tense can be used like an adjective.

A basic past tense A does B verb sentence would be: 

`少女が歩いた　→ The girl walked`

We can use the verb as an adjective, for example:

`歩いた少女が食べている　→　The girl who walked is eating`

We can use entire verb sentences as adjectives. For example (not full sentences):

`犬が玉ねぎを食べた　→　The dog ate the onion`

`玉ねぎを食べた犬が　→ The dog who ate the onion`

`犬が食べた玉ねぎ　→ The onion that was eaten by the dog`

As full sentences:

`玉ねぎを食べた犬が茶色　→ The dog who ate the onion is brown`

`犬が食べた玉ねぎ小さい　→ The onion that ws eaten by the do is small`

#### Nouns

Simple noun sentence:

`犬がやんちゃな　→ The dog is naughty`

We can move the noun to the start of the sentence to describe to the dog, but we must change the `な` in `やんちゃな` to a `だ`

`やんちゃだ犬が寝ている　→　The naughty dog is sleeping`

This is what textbooks cal the `na adjective`, which is confusing as they are nouns. We cant do this with every noun.

#### の Particle

The `の` particle works the same as `'s` in English.

`さくらのドレス　→ Sakura's dress`

`私のはな　→ My's (my) nose`

The `の` particle works the same as `'s` in English.
We don't ned to worry about things like his, your, yours etc in Japanese. As `の` is a possessive particle, we can use it to define the class to which something belongs. 

With the word `赤い` the `い` means `is` so `赤い` means is red, but not all adjectives have this `い` form. For example `ピンク色 (pink color)` has no `い` form, so we have to instead use `の` to use it as an adjectives:

`ピンク色のドレス　→ Dress belonging to the class of pink (things)　→　Pink dress`

`うさぎのオスカル　→ Rabbit belonging to the class of Oscar　→　Oscar the rabbit`
